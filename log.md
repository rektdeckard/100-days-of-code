**Thoughts:** Had some trouble figuring out how to divide up game logic before falling back to getter/setter methods.

### Day 1: January 30, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Started MarsMission program for Udacity course.

**Thoughts:** Seems pretty self-explanatory. My confidence in solving these problems has grown quite a lot.

### Day 2: January 31, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Completed MarsMission, the final lesson in the Udacity course.

**Thoughts:** Was challenged by some of the logic of the "rocket loading" subroutine, and a bit bothered by the poor efficiency of the loading algorithm. A number of other people on the forum felt the same way, and came up with a bunch of unique solutions to the problem, including sorting the cargo list before loading, using an iterator to traverse the cargo list for elements small enough to fit remaining space,

### Day 3: February 1, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Completed Android Basics: User Interface, started Android Basics: User Input

**Thoughts:** I've done these exercises before. Hopefully what I learn will stick this time, and I'll begin using these skills. Already I have the idea to create a simple recipe app to keep track of my kombucha brewing recipes, and I think that before long I'll have the skills to do it.

### Day 4: February 2, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Completed scorekeeper exercise, fleshed out idea for Brew Keeper kombucha recipe tracking app.

**Thoughts:** Brew Keeper is a recipe and brew timing app that tracks current kombucha brews and stages, stores previously used recipes and notes. The main activity will be a scrolling RecyclerView that stores in-progress brews as list items. Each item contains a Name TextView, Brew Stage Icon (1F or 2F), and Remaining Time TextView, and possibly a ProgressBar. A drop-down (expander) would show further details like ingredients and notes. A FAB on screen would prompt the user to create a new Brew, with the option to reuse a saved recipe (from Recipes Activity) or create a new one (Create Brew Activity). Tracker implements timers and notifications to keep the user updated on brew status. The app global view has a bottom Navigation Bar with three items. Previous Brews, Current Brews, and Recipes. Each would link to the appropriate Activity or Fragment.
