# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 25, 2019
#### Object-Oriented Programming for Java

**Today's Progress:** Finished MovieGuesser program for Udacity course.

**Thoughts:** Had some trouble figuring out how to divide up game logic before falling back to getter/setter methods.

### Day 1: January 30, 2019
#### Object-Oriented Programming for Java

**Today's Progress:** Started MarsMission program for Udacity course.

**Thoughts:** Seems pretty self-explanatory. My confidence in solving these problems has grown quite a lot.

### Day 2: January 31, 2019
#### Object-Oriented Programming for Java

**Today's Progress:** Completed MarsMission, the final lesson in the Udacity course.

**Thoughts:** Was challenged by some of the logic of the "rocket loading" subroutine, and a bit bothered by the poor efficiency of the loading algorithm. A number of other people on the forum felt the same way, and came up with a bunch of unique solutions to the problem, including sorting the cargo list before loading, using an iterator to traverse the cargo list for elements small enough to fit remaining space,
